Project: Where's Waldo API
=============

A RESTful API built with Node.js for a Photo Tagging App that plays like a Where's Waldo game.

This API is used in [this website.](https://odin-react-wheres-waldo.vercel.app/game)

You can also visit the front-end repository by [clicking here.](https://github.com/alansobchacki/odin-react-wheres-waldo)

### Disclaimer

This API was built as a requirement from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and contribute to the open-source community so other students can learn from the same project stages.

As directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design, and styling of your website, and so on.
>
> We recommend not doing that and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on meeting the project requirements.

### About

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) curriculum. It is the seventh project required for completion of the NodeJS course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Create the functionality that pops the targeting box and dropdown menu on the screen when the user clicks on the photo and removes it when the user clicks away.
- [x] Hook up the functionality for validating with your backend whether or not the user has clicked the right place for the character they selected from the dropdown.
- [x] Implement methods to your click logic that will normalize coordinates across different screensizes.
- [x] Tie it into your frontend so you can seamlessly select characters, validate them, and place the appropriate markers on the map if the selection was correct.
- [x] Add in the ability to time the user from when they first load the page and then display their ‚Äúscore‚Äù (time) when they successfully identify all characters.
- [x] Create a popup that asks them to enter their name for the high scores table if they have earned it.
- [x] Load many images into your database and allow the user to select from among them before starting the game.

### What I Learned

I already knew most of the concepts applied in this project, such as building a database with PostgreSQL, building queries, using an ORM, and fetching data with React.

However, this is the first project I've ever built using an API Client, and I really don't know how I managed to build APIs before üòÇ.

### Notes

This project is currently being hosted on the following platforms:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (front-end website)
- [Render](https://render.com/) (API)
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) (database)

As of today (12/17/24), this API is fully operational. This project is live thanks to the help and support of the companies above, who provide excellent free-trial services.

Should this project become unresponsive or offline, it‚Äôs most likely due to a change in the business plans of any of these providers. We all have bills to pay, so no judgment. üòÖ
